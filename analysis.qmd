## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```



```{R}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins_summary <- penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(
    n                = n(),                                  # 样本量
    mean_flipper_mm  = mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),# 翼长均值
    sd_flipper_mm    = sd(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),  # 翼长标准差
    mean_body_mass_g = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE),      # 体重均值
    sd_body_mass_g   = sd(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)         # 体重标准差
  )

# 查看结果
print(penguins_summary)

summary(penguins)


penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Flipper Length vs Body Mass",
    x     = "Flipper Length (mm)",
    y     = "Body Mass (g)",
    color = "Species"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

As you can see in Figure @fig-scatter, there’s a clear positive relationship between flipper length and body mass.

```{r fig-scatter}
#| fig-cap: "Scatterplot of flipper length vs. body mass"
#| fig-alt: "Points showing flipper length vs. body mass, colored by species"
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(x = "Flipper Length (mm)", y = "Body Mass (g)") +
  theme_minimal()
```
